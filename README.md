#Overview

This is a LUA script for the mining turtle in ComputerCraft ( Minecraft ).

Use this script at your own risk, all stuff is not yet completely tested,
I am still working on it, and it has a lot of bugs.

Completely new to LUA scripting, so my solutions might not be the best ones.

Please, feel free to contribute and give feedback.

#The scripts

* branchmine - the script which will do the branch-mining
* compactItems - a tiny script for compacting the items in turtle inventory

#Backlog

Support:
* Put up torches in tunnels
* Add chests in tunnel as security measure

Known bugs:
* Go back to start to refuel/empty inventory
* Wait for fuel should not crash
* Turtle currently ignores slots 2-3, because of future chest and torch support
